config MSM_SMEM
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on REMOTE_SPINLOCK_MSM
	bool "MSM Shared Memory (SMEM)"
	help
	  Support for the shared memory interface between the various
	  processors in the System on a Chip (SoC) which allows basic
	  inter-processor communication.

config QCOM_GSBI
        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        select MFD_SYSCON
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config QCOM_PM
	bool "Qualcomm Power Management"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM && !ARM64
	select QCOM_SCM
	help
	  QCOM Platform specific power driver to manage cores and L2 low power
	  modes. It interface with various system drivers to put the cores in
	  low power modes.

config QCOM_SMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager (SMEM)"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager.
	  The driver provides an interface to items in a heap shared among all
	  processors in a Qualcomm platform.

config QCOM_SMD
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver
	  providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm
	  platforms.

config QCOM_SMD_RPM
	tristate "Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM) over SMD"
	depends on QCOM_SMD && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".

config QCOM_PROC_COMM
	bool "Proc-Comm RPC Interface"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	help
	  Enables a lightweight communications interface to the
	  baseband processor.

config MSM_ONCRPCROUTER
	depends on MSM_SMD
	bool "MSM ONCRPC router support"
	help
	  Support for the MSM ONCRPC router for communication between
	  the ARM9 and ARM11

config MSM_ONCRPCROUTER_DEBUG
	depends on MSM_ONCRPCROUTER
	bool "MSM debug ONCRPC router support"
	help
	  Support for debugging the ONCRPC router for communication
	  between the ARM9 and ARM11

config MSM_RMT_STORAGE_CLIENT
	depends on MSM_ONCRPCROUTER
	bool "Remote Storage RPC client"
	help
	  Provide RPC mechanism for remote processors to access storage
	  device on apps processor.

config MSM_RMT_STORAGE_CLIENT_STATS
	depends on (MSM_RMT_STORAGE_CLIENT && DEBUG_FS)
	bool "Remote storage RPC client performance statistics"
	help
	  Collects performance statistics and shows this information
	  through a debugfs file rmt_storage_stats.

config MSM_DALRPC
	bool "DAL RPC support"
	depends on MSM_SMD
	help
	  Supports RPC calls to DAL devices on remote processor cores.

config MSM_SPM_V1
	bool "Driver support for SPM Version 1"
	help
	  Enables the support for Version 1 of the SPM driver. SPM hardware is
	  used to manage the processor power during sleep. The driver allows
	  configuring SPM to allow different power modes.
